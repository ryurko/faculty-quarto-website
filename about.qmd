---

I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). My research focuses on developing methods at the interface of inference and machine learning, oriented towards problems in sports analytics and natural language processing.

I previously received my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University under supervision of Professor [Kathryn Roeder](https://kathrynmroeder.github.io/) and [Max Gâ€™Sell](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mgsell/). My [thesis](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Selective_inference_approaches_for_augmenting_genetic_association_studies_with_multi-omics_metadata/19669593) work focused on selective inference approaches for augmenting genetic association studies with data-guided hypothesis testing.
