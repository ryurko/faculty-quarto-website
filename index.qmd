I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). My research focuses on developing methods at the interface of inference and machine learning, oriented towards problems in statistical genetics and sports analytics.

Interested in sports analytics? Check out what [CMSAC has to offer](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/), including:

- annual [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/2022/)

- [Open Source Sports podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/open-source-sports/id1513053248)

If you're an undergrad CMU student interested in sports analytics research, I recommend signing up for my Sports Analytics Capstone course 36-493.
