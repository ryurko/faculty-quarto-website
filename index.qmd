I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). My research focuses on developing methods at the interface of inference and machine learning, oriented towards problems in sports analytics and natural language processing. 

I am also the Director of the [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Center (CMSAC)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac), which includes:

+ [sports analytics research lab](https://cmsac-research-lab.github.io/)

+ [summer undergraduate research experience in sports analytics (aka CMSACamp)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/engagement/summer/cmsa-camp.html)

+ annual [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/)

I also maintain a Substack called [Statistical Thinking in Sports Analytics](https://statthinksportsanalytics.substack.com/) and I am actively working on a textbook titled _Statistical Methods in Sports Analytics_ (to be released in 2027).

If you're a CMU student interested in sports analytics, I recommend signing up for my Sports Analytics course 36-460/660 to learn about [relevant statistical methods for tackling challenging problems in this growing area](https://open.substack.com/pub/statthinksportsanalytics/p/statistical-thinking-in-sports-analytics?r=a5tci&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false).
