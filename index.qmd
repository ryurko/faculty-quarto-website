I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). My research focuses on developing methods at the interface of inference and machine learning, oriented towards problems in natural language processing, statistical genetics, and sports analytics.

Interested in sports analytics? Check out what [CMSAC has to offer](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/), including:

- annual [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/)
- [Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (aka CMSACamp)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/summer/)
- [Open Source Sports Substack](https://opensourcesports.substack.com/)
